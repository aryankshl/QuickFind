# QuickFind

QuickFind is a Python-based search engine that indexes data and provides an efficient way to search for specific information. It leverages indexing and mapping techniques to enhance the search functionality, allowing for faster and more accurate results.

## Features

- **Indexing**: Efficiently indexes data from the given dataset to optimize search performance.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for specific items in the dataset.
- **Mapping**: Provides a mapping of indexed data for easy reference.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simplified user interaction through a command-line or web-based interface (if applicable).

## Project Structure

```bash
├── .gitignore            # Lists files and folders to be ignored by Git
├── indexData.ipynb       # Jupyter Notebook for indexing data
├── indexMapping.py       # Python script for data mapping
├── searchApp.py          # Main application script for search functionality
├── venv/                 # Virtual environment (should be ignored by Git)
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-folder
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file or manually install any dependencies required by the project:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the indexing script**:
   Use the `indexData.ipynb` notebook to process and index your dataset.

5. **Run the search application**:
   Execute the `searchApp.py` script to start the QuickFind search engine:
   ```bash
   python searchApp.py
   ```

## Usage

- After running QuickFind, follow the prompts to input search queries and get relevant results.
- Customize the search parameters or indexing logic by modifying `indexMapping.py` and `searchApp.py`.
